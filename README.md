# FastSwitchLightDark
This simple tool makes it easy to switch between the light and dark mode on your Win10 machine.

How to use it:
1.) Pull the sources from repository
2.) Build it with Visual Studio (Community Edition in my case)
3.) Get the .exe file and start it manually or...
(4.) ...in case you want to start it automatically, add it to your autostart setup on your win10 machine.
